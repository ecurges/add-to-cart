I wanted to create a simple progressive mobile app so that a user could create their own shopping list. If you click on the list it will delete the item you previously entered. 
If you want it as a mobile app (android):
  1. Select the default browser on your phone
  2. Add/Click this link: https://kittykart.netlify.app/
  3. On the top right corner of your we browser select the 3 dotted icon
  4. Then select "Add to Home Screen"

If you want it as a mobile app (iphone):

  3. At the bottom select the share button
  4. Then select "Add to Home Screen"

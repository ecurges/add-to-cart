# About

I wanted to create a simple progressive mobile app so that a user could create their own shopping list. If you click on the list it will delete the item you previously entered. 
It's for testing purposes only. I wanted to learn how to use Firebase and test its functionality. Disclaimer: "The database is not unique to its user"
